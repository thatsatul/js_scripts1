Proper practices:

Understand requirement first before coding

Proper folder structure - Should be an exact replica of your application or resemble your application

Loosely coupled component - To reduce dependency among each other

Always try to implement more reusable component - easy modification, handles multiple scenario with one place modification and bug fixes
DRY and KISS principle

Segragate common entities in separate files like urls, navigation functions, date functions, validation functions

proper nomenclature - To understand code

unit testing

avoid unnecessary api calls

Try to perform as less query operations as possible

Avoid injecting duplicate instance of classes

Try to create first code as neat, clean and proper as possible. Its difficult to find or track unorganized code later

Do not use hard coded value of location path for images, css and other files : Declare them in environment variable or in a global constant
