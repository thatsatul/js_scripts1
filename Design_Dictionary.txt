// Given that you have a JSON of dictionary containing word - meaning pair (around 1 million words), how will you design your application (UX design, store structure, Database)

UX design:
1. We can segregate the data alphabetwise (A, B, C, D)
2. We can provide functionality to search data on basis of word / part of word or meaning / part of meaning
3. User can add word as favorite
4. On side panel, user can show similar words / opposite words.
5. If data is available - user can show sentences / examples to demonstrate word usage

Store Structure:
1. Store structure would be something like :
  {
    collection: {
        A: {
        word : {
          meaning: ,
          examples: ,
          relatedWords: {
            synonymn: ,
            antonymn: ,
          },
        },
      },
      B: {
        ...
      },
    },
    favorites: {
      ...
    },
    searchResults: {
      ...
    },
  }
